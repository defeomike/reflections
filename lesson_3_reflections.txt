When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Any time you'd like to share code or collaborate on a project. Additionally,
    it is a good way to back your code up.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    The remote repository may not include all intermediate versions that the
    local repository does, and you may not want to include the changes that
    have been made in the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are a GitHub function, which copies a repository as well as some
    metadata into your GitHub space. Clones are a Git function that works
    to pull exact copies of branches between locations. Branches set up a
    new chronicle of commits within the same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
